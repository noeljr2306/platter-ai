# Platter AI (AI Diet Planner)

This is an unfinished project that aims to help users generate a personalized weekly meal and workout plan using OpenAI's API and Firebase for user authentication and data storage.

## 🚧 Project Status

**Currently in development.**  
Some key features (like OpenAI integration) are pending due to API key subscription limitations.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – React framework for building the frontend and backend
- **TypeScript** – For strong typing and better dev experience
- **Firebase** – Authentication and Firestore database
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling the UI
- **OpenAI API** – For generating personalized weekly plans (to be added)

## 🧪 Features (Planned)

- [x] User signup and login with Firebase
- [x] Store user preferences (goals, diet, intensity)
- [ ] Generate personalized plans using OpenAI API
- [ ] Display results in a clean UI
- [ ] Save plans to Firestore

## 🚀 How to Run (Dev Mode)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

env

📌 Notes
OpenAI API integration is pending due to subscription requirement.

Will complete the feature once billing is activated.
